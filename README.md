CRM MEAN application, using Express4 (API endpoints, email templating with Handlebars) + MongoDB (Mongoose) with ES6 + Angular2 with TypeScript generated by Angular CLI.
This project is a way for me to learn, improve my Javascript skills and have fun ! 
The goal is also to show off what i'm able to do with Javascript stack to potential recruiters.

## Installation
Run npm install, it will install all dependencies for both backend and frontend.

## Backend
Run npm start, start mongod (mongod --dbpath=/Users/[username]/mongo-data/).
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/[definedRoute]` with Postman to view data sent by the API.
Check database with Robomongo.

## Frontend
Run ng serve or any other Angular CLI commands.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Use in production environment
Run ng build, set up server, then you're ready. 
Let the backend render index.html root file generated by Angular CLI and frontend manage the rest of the application.
