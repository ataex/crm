# Crm

MEAN application, using Express4 & MongoDB (Mongoose) with ES6 and Angular2 with TypeScript based on Angular CLI.
This project is only a way for me to train, learn, and have fun. The goal is also to show to potential recruiters what i'm able to do with Javascript stack.

## Backend
Run npm start, start mongod (mongod --dbpath=/Users/thomasbousquet/mongo-data/).
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` with Postman.
Check database with Robomongo.

## Frontend
Run ng serve or any other Angular CLI commands.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
